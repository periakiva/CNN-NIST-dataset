# CNN-NIST-dataset
This code is partially based on a VGG practical done by Oxford - some functions were used.
This is a MATLAB implementation using the pre trained model "imagenet-matconvnet-vgg-verydeep-16" to detect letters and digits out of NIST image data set. 
Before proceeding with this code, you should have matconvnet in the same path as the project.
